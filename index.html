# What is this presentation?

It will cover:
- a new online service for using an online service
- what service? Identity
- so what?
- what is it?
- how to get it?
- I have questions

It will not cover:
- in depth overview of identity
- technical deep dive on implementation

# A new online service to use an online service

If you are building an online service and want to use the identity online service, you can now use a new online service to request that your online service get setup with the identity online service.

Easy, right? But first, some context.

# Identity project status (nickel tour)

eServices will be the home to the Yukon identity service, a government-backed digital identity. Part of this is a single account to log in to access gov't services. Works for staff logins too.

We've done a public procurement and technology proof-of-concepts, branding and comms work.

Waiting for regulations to enable a more complete identity service. In the meantime we're supporting Single Sign On. 

As part of the delay we're not yet publicly using the brand name.

We have a modest number of services currently using this system, and more starting soon.

Our standard at YG is to use this identity service as the clearinghouse for all authentication.  We're aiming for a single consistent and unified identity integration story for both YG staff and other (contractors, citizens, etc). 

---

# What does this mean to me?

Able to support staff authentication and/or contractor or public authenticating without needing everyone to be in AD.

No more managing user password, password resets, etc. 

Fewer accounts and passwords for your users.

Not included:

- Authorization. Authorization still needs to happen at the application layer.
- Magic. Applications likely need to do some onboarding. Possibly account matching.

---

# What we have

We have an identity service provider who can support citizen and staff logins. The vendor is Auth0.

We have a single integration point for applications that need authentication. Citizens authenticate using email and password, staff authenticate via Azure AD.

Uses open/common standards: Open ID Connect (OIDC), OAuth2, SAML2.

We have 3 environments: dev, UAT and prod.

Sample code, reference implementations and templates.

# How, who and when?

Who is this for, how do you get access, and when should that happen?

---

## How, who and when?

# Who is this for?

This is for staff or contractors who are working on applications (internal or public-facing) that require authentication.

It is intended for someone with technical knowledge of how authentication will be handled, but the form is very simple, so hopefully anyone can use it.

---

## How, who and when?

# How to get access

We created an online service to formally request access to the test tenant.

It's called: Setup a new app for authentication testing

It is available at:
https://service.yukon.ca/forms/en/setup_new_app_for_authentication_testing

## How, who and when?

# When should we do this?

Earlier is better, though we've had some projects use alternative authentication systems during development and then setup with Yukon SSO only for final integration testing.
